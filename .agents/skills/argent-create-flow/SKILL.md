description: Record a reusable flow (scripted sequence of MCP tool calls) that can be replayed later with a single command. Use when the user asks to create, record, or build a flow, or to script a sequence of device actions. Also used proactively, without an explicit request, when a multi-step interaction sequence is about to be repeated (re-profiling, re-testing, or a complex path worth saving).

## Overview

A flow is a sequence of steps saved to a `.yaml` file in the `.argent/flows/` directory. Each recorded step is **executed live** as you add it, so you verify it works before it becomes part of the flow. Replay a finished flow with `flow-execute`, or — for an e2e flow — headlessly with `argent flow run <name>`.

Flows store **no device id**: the runner binds a device (the single booted one, or pass `device`/`platform`). A recorded coordinate `gesture-tap` is captured as a portable `tap: { selector }` step whenever the tapped element has stable text/identifier.

**Two flow types**

- **e2e** — begins with a `launch:` step, which starts that app from scratch (terminate + relaunch), so the flow controls its own start state. No `executionPrerequisite`. May `run:` other flows, and (on iOS/Android) may itself be a `run:` target — when nested, its `launch` runs inline, restarting the app for that sub-scenario. **Chromium is the exception:** the runner boots one Electron app per run (the top-level flow's), so a nested chromium e2e flow's `launch` can't boot its own instance and fails the run — keep chromium e2e flows top-level. Record one by adding a `restart-app` of the app under test as the **first** step — it is captured as the `launch` step.
- **fragment** — doesn't begin with a launch; runs against the device's current state. May declare an `executionPrerequisite` (a documented entry-state contract). Invoked from other flows via a `run:` step, or directly by you at any time.

Both run via `argent flow run <name>` — a fragment simply runs against whatever is on screen (its prerequisite is printed as a reminder). Only e2e flows are meaningful CI/suite entries, since only they give a deterministic verdict from a clean start.

### Step directives

Beyond raw `tool:` steps and `echo:`, flows support declarative directives interpreted by the runner (they are **not** agent-callable tools). **Every directive hard-stops the flow on failure**; later steps are reported `skip`.

| Directive    | YAML                                                                                                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         |

### Selectors

A **selector** is `{ text?, id?, role? }` plus the optional scopes below (all-must-match; `text`/`role` are case-insensitive substrings, `id` matches the element's testID / accessibilityIdentifier / resource-id exactly, case-insensitive, also accepting the unqualified Android resource-id name — `submit` matches `com.example.app:id/submit`) — the same semantics `await-ui-element` uses, though that tool spells the `id` field `identifier` (flow YAML also accepts `identifier` as an alias for `id`, but `id` is the canonical spelling and what the recorder writes). A bare string is a _loose_ selector: it resolves **identifier-first, then falls back to text** (label/value), so `tap: Login` matches a `testID="Login"` or, failing that, visible text "Login" — no need to know which. Loose fallback applies uniformly to every selector slot (`tap`, `type.into`, `await`, `assert`, `scroll-to`). Use the map form to be strict: `{ id: submit-btn }` (identifier only) or `{ text: Login }` (text only, no fallback).

`text` also takes a **regex matcher map** — `{ text: { matches: '^Order #\d+$' } }`, in any selector slot — for dynamic text no literal can pin. It tests each node's native **own** label/value (not the adapter-hoisted `subtreeText`), though on iOS a container's own label may itself aggregate descendant text, so a wrapper and its leaf can both match. Same regex rules as `text.in`'s `matches` (see _`await` and `assert`_): unanchored, **case-sensitive**, single-quoted, invalid pattern fails at parse. So `assert: { visible: { text: { matches: '^Taps: \d+$' } } }` asserts a counter is on screen with no locator at all, and `tap: { text: { matches: '^Order #\d+$' } }` taps a dynamic row — though a stable `id` stays the more robust action target.

#### Scopes — CSS combinators, read off frames

A map selector may also carry a **scope**: a nested selector naming another element the match must sit in a given spatial relation to. These are the geometric readings of the CSS combinators that survive a flattened tree — the child combinator `>` has no analog, since parent/child structure does not reach replay. They combine, and nest up to six scopes per selector:

| Scope           | CSS     | Reads as                                                        | Example                                                               |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `within: <sel>` | `A B`   | the match's frame sits **inside** the scope element's frame     | `tap: { text: Delete, within: { id: profile-card } }`                 |
| `after: <sel>`  | `A ~ B` | the match **follows** the scope element in reading order        | `assert: { visible: { role: Button, after: { text: Danger zone } } }` |
| `next: <sel>`   | `A + B` | as `after`, narrowed to the **nearest** follower of each anchor | `tap: { role: Switch, next: { text: Wi-Fi } }`                        |

And `any: true` is the CSS `*` universal selector. It carries no locator of its own, so the parser enforces two rules: it needs **at least one scope** (a bare `any: true` would match the whole screen), and it may **not** sit beside `text`/`id`/`role` (which it would only make redundant — write `{ role: Switch, next: … }`, not `{ any: true, role: Switch, next: … }`). Only the literal `true` is accepted. `assert: { hidden: { any: true, within: { id: empty-state } } }` asserts an empty container. It works for actions too — `tap: { any: true, next: { text: Airplane Mode } }` taps whatever sits right after that label — but on a real tree "whatever" includes spacers and wrappers, so **name the target** (`role`, `id`) whenever you can and keep `any` for conditions and for `next`, which reduces to a single element per anchor.

All of it is **visual (frame-based), not tree ancestry** — flow trees are flattened, and "inside the card" / "the switch after this label" mean what the screen shows — the same frame-based reading of "within" that `scroll-to`'s container anchor uses. Every scope needs a **distinct element** (nothing scopes itself, so `{ id: card, within: { id: card } }` needs two nested elements), the synthetic screen root never counts, and a scope only narrows _where_ to look — the selector still needs its own `text`/`id`/`role` naming _what_ to find there, or `any: true`. The nested slot takes every selector form: a bare string keeps the loose identifier-first fallback (`within: profile-card`), the map form stays strict, the regex matcher works (`within: { text: { matches: '^Card \d+$' } }`). Scopes are flow-YAML only; the raw `await-ui-element` tool's selector accepts none of them. Prefer a unique `id` on the target itself when one exists — reach for a scope when the target has no unique locator of its own (repeated row actions, per-card buttons, list cells).

**`within`** — `tap: { text: Delete, within: { id: profile-card } }` taps the Delete button in the profile card even when other cards show identical ones; `tap: { text: "Pin feed", within: { text: "For You" } }` picks one card's button out of a whole list. Scope to a container with a **tight frame** (a row, card, dialog, toast): a full-screen wrapper contains everything and scopes nothing. It chains outward: `{ text: Save, within: { id: cards, within: Settings } }` reads "Save inside cards inside Settings", each container's frame inside the next.

**`after` / `next`** — reading order is row-band aware: an element **follows** the anchor when it starts below the anchor's bottom edge, _or_ shares its row band and sits entirely to its right. That is what makes `{ role: Switch, next: { text: Wi-Fi } }` resolve the Wi-Fi row's own switch even though the taller switch's frame starts a couple of pixels _higher_ than the label's. `next` keeps only the nearest follower — a match in the anchor's own row beats anything on the rows below, leftmost first — while `after` keeps them all, so `assert: { hidden: { role: Button, after: { text: Danger zone } } }` holds when nothing button-like appears past that heading. Both union over anchors exactly as CSS does: with three rows on screen, `{ role: Switch, next: { role: AXStaticText } }` yields all three switches, one per label. Note that "follows" is **not transitive** — against a tall anchor, an element can follow something that itself follows the anchor without following the anchor directly — so nesting `after` scopes is not the same as chaining CSS `~`: `{ after: { …, after: … } }` can match elements a single `after` excludes. Nest them only when each link is a container-sized step. An element sitting _inside_ the anchor does not follow **that** anchor — containment is not reading order — so scope by `within` for that.

**Prefer the map form for a scope's anchor.** A bare-string scope (`next: wifi-row`) keeps the loose identifier-first fallback, and the runner takes the first pass that finds a _visible_ match — so if some unrelated element carries `testID="wifi-row"`, the identifier pass wins and the text pass never runs. Reproduced: with a decoy `testID="Wi-Fi"` elsewhere on screen, `tap: { role: Switch, next: Wi-Fi }` taps the decoy's neighbour and reports a pass. This is the ordinary identifier-first doctrine, but a scope makes a decoy likelier to "succeed": a decoy _container_ only wins if it actually holds a match, while a decoy _anchor_ wins if anything at all sits after it — which on a real screen it usually does. Spell an anchor you care about as a map: `next: { text: Wi-Fi }` or `next: { id: wifi-row }`.

One way `next` is deliberately **looser than CSS `+`**: where `A + B` matches nothing unless the very next sibling is a `B`, `next` keeps looking and returns the nearest match further on. That is what makes it survive the wrapper and spacer nodes a flattened tree is full of, but it also means a row that is _missing_ the control you asked for silently resolves to the next row's — `{ role: Switch, next: { text: Wi-Fi } }` on a Wi-Fi row rendered without a switch returns the _Bluetooth_ row's switch rather than failing. When a row may legitimately lack the control, assert it first (`assert: { visible: { role: Switch, within: { id: wifi-row } } }`) or scope by `within` instead.

Scopes compose, and it matters which one carries them. `{ role: Button, next: { text: Name, within: { id: card-b } } }` scopes the **anchor** — one label, so one pick, but that pick may land outside card-b. `{ role: Button, next: { text: Name }, within: { id: card-b } }` scopes the **target** — every label is still an anchor, but only card-b's buttons can be picked. They agree on a well-formed screen and diverge when card-b has no button: the first reaches on to the next card's, the second returns nothing. Scope the target when the container is the thing you trust. Conditions honor scopes like any other selector: `assert: { hidden: { text: Saved, within: { id: toast-area } } }` holds when nothing matching "Saved" is inside the toast area — matches elsewhere on screen don't count, and a missing scope element satisfies `hidden` (and fails `visible`/`exists`).

Selectors resolve against the **full native hierarchy** (iOS: the UIView tree; Android: the complete accessibility hierarchy including not-important views) — strictly more than `describe` or the raw `await-ui-element` tool see (both use the trimmed tree), with complete `testID`/`resource-id` coverage. So an `id` selector works even when `describe` collapses or omits the element — don't fall back to coordinate taps just because a testID isn't visible in `describe` output. And when several elements match — including wrappers whose native text aggregates descendant content — the action directives (`tap`, `type`, `scroll-to`) pick the **most specific** match: an exact text/identifier match beats a substring hit (for a regex matcher, a pattern consuming the element's whole text counts as exact), then the smallest frame wins. (A universal `any: true` selector has no field to be exact about, so its matches rank by reading order instead — the first element in the scope, which is the element a condition reads too. Where two matches share a top-left corner, an action breaks the tie toward the smaller, more specific one and a condition does not, so those two can name different elements.)

**Quote strings YAML would mangle.** An unquoted `#` starts a YAML comment — `tap: Order #1234` silently parses as `tap: Order` — and bare `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off`/numbers coerce to non-strings. When a selector or typed text contains `#`, `:`, quotes, or could read as a boolean/number, wrap it: `tap: "Order #1234"`.

### `await` and `assert`

The **condition is the key**, and its value is the selector:

- `{ visible: Home }`, `{ exists: { id: row } }`, `{ hidden: spinner }`
- `{ text: { in: <selector>, contains: "Taps:" } }` or `{ text: { in: <selector>, equals: "Taps: 0" } }` — `text` locates an element (`in`) and checks its rendered content against exactly one of `contains` (case-insensitive substring) or `equals` (case-insensitive exact match — use it when boundaries matter: `contains: "Taps: 3"` is also satisfied by "Taps: 30"). Reach for `text` only when the locator is an identifier/role; to assert a string is simply on screen, prefer `{ visible: "Taps: 0" }`.
- `{ text: { in: total, matches: 'Total: \$\d+\.\d{2}' } }` — the third comparator: a JS regex for dynamic content (counters, prices, dates) that neither literal mode can pin. Unanchored like `contains` (anchor with `^…$` for the `equals` analog) and — unlike the literal modes — **case-sensitive**: the pattern carries its own semantics. An invalid pattern fails at parse time. **Quote the pattern in single quotes**: single-quoted and plain YAML scalars keep backslashes; double quotes would need `\\d`. To assert a dynamic string is simply on screen with no locator, prefer a regex **selector** — `{ visible: { text: { matches: '^Taps: \d+$' } } }` (see Selectors); `text.in` + `matches` is for checking a specific element's aggregated text.
- A container's text aggregates its descendants' text (space-joined), so `text` can assert what a testID wrapper visibly shows even when the string lives in a child node. That also means `equals` against a wrapper must match _everything_ it shows or exactly the wrapper's own label/value — targeting the leaf holding exactly the value (or using `contains`) stays the clearer spelling.

This condition-as-key form is the only spelling. `await` also accepts an optional `timeout` sibling key in milliseconds — `- await: { visible: Home, timeout: 15000 }` — for a transition that legitimately needs longer than the default budget. **Omit `timeout` by default**: the default budget covers normal transitions, and a habitual generous override just delays failure reporting on every broken step. Add one only after a step demonstrably needs it — it timed out at the default and the wait is legitimately slow (a cold start, a network round-trip, a long animation). `assert` has no timeout override: a check that needs seconds to become true is a wait — spell it `await`.

For a custom poll interval or bundleId, drop to an explicit `- tool: await-ui-element` step — but the raw tool polls the trimmed `describe` tree, so a testID it reports as not found can still resolve fine as an `await:` directive (see Selectors). Prefer the directive.

### `type` and `scroll-to`

`type` presses Enter after typing to commit the value and dismiss the keyboard, so it can't cover later targets. For a chained form whose fields feed one explicit submit — e.g. email then password then a `tap: "Log in"` — set `submit: false` on the intermediate fields so a premature Enter doesn't fire the form early: `type: { into: password, text: "hunter2", submit: false }`.

Never record a real credential into a flow — the YAML is committed to the repo. Use a secret placeholder instead: `type: { into: password, text: "{{secret:APP_PASSWORD}}" }`. The placeholder is stored verbatim (the YAML stays secret-free) and is resolved at run time by the tool-server from the `ARGENT_SECRET_APP_PASSWORD` environment variable — including agent-less `argent flow run` in CI, where the variable comes from the job's secrets.

`scroll-to` takes an optional `direction` (`up` | `down` | `left` | `right`, default `down` — so the common case is just `- scroll-to: <selector>`) and optionally a `within: <selector>` that anchors the scroll inside a specific container — required to drive a **nested** scroller (e.g. a horizontal carousel inside a vertical list), since the device can't be asked which container to scroll. This step-level `within` (a sibling of `target`) anchors the _gesture_, and it is the **only** scope key the step body takes — `after:`/`next:`/`any:` beside `target` are rejected. It is distinct from a selector's scopes (see Selectors), which `target` may itself carry — `scroll-to: { target: { text: Delete, within: { id: cards } }, within: { id: settings-list } }` scrolls the settings list until the Delete button _inside the cards container_ is visible. It scrolls in bounded momentum-free increments, re-checks after each, and stops if a scroll reveals nothing new (end of the container). `tap`/`type` do **not** scroll — add a `scroll-to` before any target that may be off-screen. It's a no-op when the target is already visible, so a defensive `scroll-to` costs nothing on replay and keeps the flow working on smaller screens.

### `snapshot` cropping

`cropOn: <selector>` narrows a snapshot's comparison to one element's region — `- snapshot: { name: cart-total, cropOn: { id: order-summary } }`. The selector resolves like a directive target (settled tree, auto-wait, the standard not-found failure; selector-only, no point form), and the **cropped** image is what gets compared, stored as the baseline, and reported as the `current` artifact; the baseline filename still keys on the full capture's resolution — plus a `-crop-<hash>` selector suffix — so device-class drift is still caught. A cropped comparison never masks any region — every pixel of the crop is compared — so prefer elements clear of the top status-bar band (a crop overlapping it leans on best-effort status-bar pinning, and the clock/battery may diff). Crop **fixed-size containers**, addressed by `id`: a text selector resolves to the smallest matching node — typically the label itself, whose frame tracks text metrics — and the crop tracks the element's frame, so an element that grew or shrank by a pixel fails on dimensions ("nothing was compared") rather than on content. Baseline storage and seeding are covered under _Standalone runner_.

### TV targets (Vega)

A Vega (Fire TV) device is remote-driven — there is no touch input, so the touch directives (`tap`, `long-press`, `type`, `scroll-to`, `pinch`, `rotate`) fail on it with guidance. Drive focus with `tool: tv-remote` steps and type with `tool: keyboard` instead; everything else (`launch`, `await`, `assert`, `wait`, `snapshot`, `echo`, `run`, selectors) works unchanged — the tree comes from the on-device automation toolkit, which attaches at app launch (the `launch` step waits for it, so a leading `launch` also guarantees selectors resolve).

```yaml
steps:
  - launch: com.example.app.main # the interactive component id from manifest.toml
  - await: { visible: Home }
  - tool: tv-remote
    args: { button: [down, select] } # move focus, then confirm — one step per navigation
  - await: { visible: Explore Screen }
  - snapshot: explore
```

Since a `tv-remote` path is positional (like a coordinate tap), gate each navigation with an `await` on the destination screen and echo where focus should be — that is what makes the flow diagnosable when the focus order changes.

### Standalone runner

`argent flow run <name> [--device <id>] [--platform ios|android|chromium|vega] [--update-baselines] [--output <dir>] [--json]` runs a flow with no LLM in the loop and exits non-zero on any failure — suitable for CI (e2e flows; a fragment runs against the current device state, useful while authoring). `snapshot` baselines live in `.argent/flows/__baselines__/<flow>/`, keyed by platform + resolution; a `snapshot` step **fails** when no baseline exists for the run's device class, so seed baselines with `--update-baselines` and have the user review and commit `__baselines__/` — and pin the device class in CI (`--device`/`--platform`, same simulator model) so runs compare against the committed key. The status bar is pinned (iOS `simctl status_bar`, Android demo mode) for the run so it doesn't drive visual diffs. `--output <dir>` writes each failed snapshot's baseline/current/diff images to `<dir>/<flow>/` — a stable path for CI artifact upload.

## Tools

| Tool                     | Purpose                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flow-start-recording`   | Start recording — takes a name and (fragments only) an optional `executionPrerequisite`; creates the file |
| `flow-add-step`          | Execute a tool call live and record it if it succeeds                                                     |
| `flow-add-echo`          | Add a label/comment that prints during replay                                                             |
| `flow-finish-recording`  | Stop recording and get a summary                                                                          |
| `flow-read-prerequisite` | Read a flow's execution prerequisite without running it                                                   |
| `flow-execute`           | Replay a saved flow by name                                                                               |

Every tool during recording returns the current flow file contents, so you can track what has been recorded. Rules:

- **Every step runs live.** You see the real tool result (including screenshots) — verify the step worked before continuing. **Only successful steps are recorded**: a failed call writes nothing to the flow file; fix the issue and try again.
- **Pass `project_root` once.** Give the absolute `project_root` (an error is returned if the path is not absolute) to `flow-start-recording` — it is stored for the session and used by all subsequent flow tools. You do **not** pass a flow name to `flow-add-step`, `flow-add-echo`, or `flow-finish-recording` — the active flow is tracked automatically.
- **Start before adding.** Calling those tools without an active recording returns _"No active flow. Call flow-start-recording first."_
- **One flow at a time.** `flow-start-recording` while already recording switches to the new flow — the response tells you which flow was abandoned and which is now active; the old flow's file remains on disk.
- **Mistakes can be edited out.** Edit the `.yaml` file directly to remove or reorder steps.

### flow-add-step arguments

The `command` parameter is the MCP tool name; `args` is a **JSON string** (not an object), omitted entirely for tools with no arguments:

```
command: "gesture-tap"
args: "{\"udid\": \"<UDID>\", \"x\": 0.5, \"y\": 0.35}"

command: "await-ui-element"
args: "{\"udid\": \"<UDID>\", \"condition\": \"visible\", \"selector\": {\"text\": \"Continue\"}}"
```

Record an `await-ui-element` step to **gate** the next step on a screen transition — it blocks until the element is `visible`/`hidden` (or contains `text`), so the following step runs only once the screen has actually settled; prefer this over a fixed `delayMs`. If its condition is not met before the timeout, replay **stops at that step** (the steps after it assume the transition happened). See the `await-ui-element` section of `argent-device-interact` for the full condition/selector reference. The live call sees only the trimmed `describe` tree — if it can't find an identifier you know exists, gate on visible text to get the step recorded, then retarget the identifier in the `await:` form during polish (the directive resolves the full hierarchy — see Selectors); don't conclude the testID is unusable in the flow.

## Recording

1. **Start, then launch as the first step (e2e) or set the stage yourself (fragment).** Call `flow-start-recording` with a descriptive name and the absolute `project_root`. For an **e2e** flow, record a `restart-app` of the app under test as the **first** step — it runs live (resetting the device for the rest of the recording) and is captured as the flow's `launch` step. For a **fragment**, bring the device to the entry state _before_ recording and pass an `executionPrerequisite` describing it (e.g. "App on the login screen") to `flow-start-recording` instead.
2. **Build step-by-step**: for each action, call `flow-add-step` with the tool name and args. The tool runs immediately — check the result before moving on, and gate each navigation with an `await-ui-element` step.
3. **Add labels**: use `flow-add-echo` between steps — echo the expected state, not just the action (see _Making flows resilient_).
4. **Finish**: call `flow-finish-recording`. It returns the file path where the flow was saved and a summary of all steps.
5. **Polish**: **read the saved `.yaml` file** and convert the raw `tool:` steps that have a cleaner directive form (the recorder leaves these as tools):
   - `tool: keyboard` typing into a field → `type: { into: "<field>", text: "…" }`, folding in the `tap` that focused the field.
   - `tool: await-ui-element` gating a transition → `await: { visible: "…" }` / `{ hidden: … }` / `{ text: { in: …, equals: … } }`, carrying a custom `timeoutMs` over as a `timeout` sibling key. Converting also upgrades the wait from the trimmed `describe` tree to the flow's full-hierarchy tree (see Selectors). Keep the raw `tool: await-ui-element` step only when it sets a custom `pollIntervalMs`/`bundleId` the directive can't express.
   - A scroll-to-reach-an-element — a `tool: gesture-swipe` (or its chromium analog, `gesture-scroll`) used to bring a specific element on screen before interacting with it (a `tap`, `type`, `assert`, …) → `scroll-to: { target: "<that element>", direction: … }`, dropping the swipe. This is far more robust than a fixed-distance swipe: it scrolls momentum-free and stops exactly when the target appears, so it survives layout and content changes. (`tap`/`type` do not scroll, so a raw swipe whose fling lands differently on another device leaves the following tap unresolved — always prefer the `scroll-to` rewrite.) Keep a `gesture-swipe` as a raw `tool:` step when it isn't scrolling toward a specific element — especially a velocity-dependent gesture like swipe-to-dismiss, edge-swipe-back, or swipe-to-reveal a row action, which a momentum-free `scroll-to` would not reproduce.
   - `tool: gesture-pinch` → `pinch: { on: "<target>", scale: … }`, deriving `scale` as `endDistance / startDistance`. Set `on:` to the element under the pinch center when the pinch was aimed at one (the map or image being zoomed); omit it for a screen-center pinch. Don't carry the recorded distances/angle over — the directive re-derives the geometry (finger placement, system-edge avoidance, chaining of large scales) at run time, so the conversion swaps device-specific coordinates for a portable selector with auto-wait. Keep the raw `tool: gesture-pinch` step when the pinch is anchored at a specific point _inside_ a large element (zooming toward a particular map location, not the map's center) or deliberately pans via `endCenterX`/`endCenterY` — `on:` takes only a selector and re-centers the pinch on the element's frame center, so converting would silently move the zoom anchor.
   - `tool: gesture-rotate` → `rotate: { on: "<target>", by: … }`, deriving `by` as `endAngle − startAngle` (the tool's `endAngle` > `startAngle` turns clockwise, matching the directive's positive `by`). Set `on:` to the element under the rotation center when the rotation was aimed at one (the map or image being rotated); omit it for a screen-center rotation. Don't carry the recorded `centerX`/`centerY`, radii (`radius` or `radiusX`/`radiusY`), `startAngle`, or `durationMs` over — the directive re-derives the geometry (finger placement, physical-circle radius, system-edge avoidance) and runs at a fixed pace (~90° per 300 ms), so the conversion swaps device-specific coordinates for a portable selector with auto-wait. Keep the raw `tool: gesture-rotate` step when the rotation is anchored at a specific point _inside_ a large element rather than its center (the directive re-centers on the element's frame center, so converting would silently move the pivot), when the gesture's speed itself matters (the directive's pace is fixed), or when the sweep exceeds the directive's ±3000° bound.

Every other recorded tool (a velocity-dependent `gesture-swipe`, a fixed-distance `gesture-scroll` not aimed at an element, `button`, `screenshot`, …) has no directive form — leave it as a `tool:` step. The recorder already handles the rest: coordinate `gesture-tap`s are captured as portable `tap:` selector steps, a `restart-app` is captured as a `launch:` step, a `flow-execute` of a sibling fragment is captured as a `run: <name>` composition directive, and device ids are stripped. Captured selectors are emitted in the strict map form (`tap: { text: General }`), never as a loose bare string — the recorder verified the exact element the tap hit, and a bare string would re-parse as loose and route through the identifier-first fallback it was never checked against. After editing, re-run with `flow-execute` to confirm the cleaned flow still passes.

### Example session

```
flow-start-recording  { name: "open-about", project_root: "/Users/dev/MyApp" }
flow-add-echo  { message: "Start Settings from scratch" }
flow-add-step  { command: "restart-app", args: "{\"udid\": \"ABC\", \"bundleId\": \"com.apple.Preferences\"}" }   # ⇒ captured as `- launch: com.apple.Preferences` — this is now an e2e flow
flow-add-echo  { message: "On the Settings root list, tapping the 'General' row" }
flow-add-step  { command: "gesture-tap", args: "{\"udid\": \"ABC\", \"x\": 0.5, \"y\": 0.35}" }   # ⇒ captured as `- tap: { text: General }` (portable selector, no udid)
flow-add-step  { command: "await-ui-element", args: "{\"udid\": \"ABC\", \"condition\": \"visible\", \"selector\": {\"text\": \"About\"}}" }   # gate the transition
flow-add-echo  { message: "On Settings > General, tapping 'About'" }
flow-add-step  { command: "gesture-tap", args: "{\"udid\": \"ABC\", \"x\": 0.5, \"y\": 0.17}" }
flow-add-step  { command: "await-ui-element", args: "{\"udid\": \"ABC\", \"condition\": \"visible\", \"selector\": {\"text\": \"Model Name\"}}" }
flow-finish-recording  {}
```

Then polish the saved file: the two `await-ui-element` steps become `await:` directives (see the file below).

## Replaying

Call `flow-execute` with the flow name (and `project_root`, unless a recording this session already stored it). If the flow has an execution prerequisite, the tool returns a **notice** with the prerequisite text instead of running — verify the prerequisite is met (you can also inspect it beforehand with `flow-read-prerequisite`) and call `flow-execute` again with `prerequisiteAcknowledged: true`. A flow without a prerequisite runs immediately. The run executes all steps in order and returns a structured report: `{ ok, passed, failed, skipped, errored, steps }`.

**What each step reports.** Raw `tool:` steps include the underlying tool's full `result` (screenshots and other outputs render as usual). The directive steps are summarized: `tap`/`type`/`await`/`assert` report only `status` + `reason`, and `snapshot` adds `artifacts` only when there is something to look at — a failed comparison (baseline/current/diff paths), a missing-baseline failure (`current` only), or a baseline write; a clean pass reports just `status` + `reason`. So converting a `tool: gesture-tap` into a `tap:` directive during cleanup drops only that tap's (uninteresting) raw result — output-bearing tools like `screenshot` have no directive form and stay `tool:` steps, so their results keep flowing through.

## Flow file format

The top-level is an object with `steps` (array) and — fragments only — `executionPrerequisite` (an e2e flow, one beginning with `launch:`, has none). Besides the directives above:

- `- echo: <message>` — a label printed during replay
- `- tool: <name>` with optional `args:` — a raw tool call. A tool step may also carry `delayMs: <ms>` to sleep that long before it runs. (`await-ui-element` is an ordinary tool step; see _flow-add-step arguments_ and _Making flows resilient_ for when to gate a transition with one.)
- **`when:` blocks** handle one-sided divergences (interstitials, coach marks): `- when: { visible: "What's new" }` with a sibling `steps: [...]` list runs the block only if the condition holds — checked once with the short assert grace (~1s), so a skipped block barely costs a clean run. Guards are one condition key (`exists`/`visible`/`hidden`/`text`, the await/assert shapes) or `platform: ios|android|chromium|vega`. **No else** (parse-rejected): a block exists to dismiss the divergence and reconverge, never to test two paths — two paths are two flows. Failures inside an entered block are real failures; a skipped block reports `skip` lines. Tap-if-present is a one-step block (`when: { visible: "Got it" }` + `steps: [tap: "Got it"]`); there is NO per-step `optional:` key — it is rejected at parse with a pointer to `when:`.

The polished result of the example session above:

```yaml
steps:
  - echo: Start Settings from scratch
  - launch: com.apple.Preferences
  - echo: On the Settings root list, tapping the 'General' row
  - tap: { text: General }
  - await: { visible: About }
  - echo: On Settings > General, tapping 'About'
  - tap: { text: About }
  - await: { visible: Model Name }
```

Note there is **no device id** anywhere in the file — the recorder strips them and the runner injects the bound device.

## When to proactively record a flow

Proactive recording is part of this skill's scope (see the description). Record a flow without waiting to be asked — telling the user you are doing so — when you recognize any of these patterns:

- **About to re-profile**: You completed a profiling session and are about to apply a fix and re-profile. Record the interaction steps now so the re-profile replays them identically (see `argent-react-native-profiler` and `argent-native-profiler` skills).
- **Repeating steps**: You have already performed a multi-step interaction sequence once and the task requires doing it again (comparison, retry, re-test).
- **Complex path discovered**: You worked through a non-trivial sequence of taps/swipes/navigation to reach a desired app state. Capture it before it is lost.
- **User says "again" / "one more time"**: Any request to redo what you just did is a signal to record first, then replay.

## Flow self-improvement

Flows break. UI layouts change, coordinates drift, screens get added or removed. When `flow-execute` returns a failure, follow this procedure to diagnose and fix the flow instead of silently re-recording or giving up.

### Classify the result

After every `flow-execute`, classify the outcome before proceeding:

| Outcome                | Signal                                                                | Action             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Success**            | All steps completed, final screenshot shows expected state            | Continue with task |
| **Hard error**         | A step has `ERROR` in the result — engine stopped there               | Enter **Diagnose** |
| **Silent misfire**     | All steps completed but final screenshot shows wrong screen           | Enter **Diagnose** |
| **Partial divergence** | Intermediate screenshot shows wrong state even though later steps ran | Enter **Diagnose** |

For silent misfires and partial divergence, echo annotations (see _Making flows resilient_) are your reference for what each screen _should_ look like.

### Diagnose

1. Note the failure step index and error message (if hard error).
2. Call `screenshot` to see where the app actually is now.
3. Call `describe` or `debugger-component-tree` to get the current element tree. Remember `describe` shows less than the flow tree — a testID missing from its output can still resolve as a selector (see Selectors).
4. Compare current state to what the failed step expected. Classify the root cause:

| Root cause       | Symptoms                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordinate drift | Tap succeeded but hit wrong element; elements shifted positions |
| Missing element  | Target element not present in element tree                      |
| Wrong screen     | Screenshot shows entirely different page than expected          |
| Timing           | Element exists in tree but tap missed; loading spinner visible  |
| State mismatch   | First step fails — executionPrerequisite was not actually met   |

5. State the diagnosis in one sentence before attempting any correction.

### Correct

Choose the lightest strategy that fits:

**Strategy 1 — Edit the YAML** (coordinate drift, parameter changes).
Read `.argent/flows/<flow-name>.yaml`, update the broken step's `x`/`y`, `bundleId`, `text`, or other args. Re-run `flow-execute` to verify.

**Strategy 2 — Manual recovery + continue** (timing/transient issues, one-off replay).
Manually execute the failed step with corrected coordinates from the Diagnose step, then manually execute remaining steps. Does not fix the YAML — use only when re-recording is not worth it.

**Strategy 3 — Re-record from failure point** (structural changes, new intermediate screens).
Navigate the app to the state just before the failure point. Call `flow-start-recording` with the same flow name (overwrites). Re-add the working prefix steps via `flow-add-step`, then continue recording new steps from the divergence point. Call `flow-finish-recording`.

**Strategy 4 — Full re-record** (major changes, unclear diagnosis, or 3+ broken steps).
Reset the app to prerequisite state (`restart-app` + `launch-app`). Record from scratch with the same flow name.

**Decision heuristic:**

- 1 step broken, parameter-only change → Strategy 1
- 1 step broken, transient issue, not worth persisting → Strategy 2
- 2–3 steps broken or flow structure partially changed → Strategy 3
- 3+ steps broken, or unclear root cause → Strategy 4
- Flow used for profiling comparison (must be identical) → Strategy 4

### Verify and bound retries

After applying a correction, re-run `flow-execute` to verify.

- If it succeeds → done. Report what changed (e.g. "Fixed step 4: updated tap coordinates from 0.5,0.35 to 0.5,0.42").
- If it fails at a **different** step → return to Diagnose for a second attempt.
- If this is already the second correction attempt → **stop**. Report the diagnosis to the user and recommend a full re-record or manual investigation.

**Hard cap: 2 correction cycles.** Do not enter an unbounded fix loop.

### Making flows resilient

Apply these when recording new flows to reduce future breakage:

- **Echo expected state, not just actions.** Write `"On Settings > General screen, about to tap About"` not `"Tap About"`. During diagnosis these tell you what the screen _should_ look like.
- **Gate transitions with `await-ui-element`, not fixed delays.** After a tap that triggers a navigation, record an `await-ui-element` step that waits for the next screen's element to be `visible` (or a spinner to be `hidden`) before the following step — converted to an `await:` directive during polish. This removes the **Timing** failure mode in Diagnose (the element is in the tree but the tap fired before the screen settled) and is more reliable than `delayMs` or an extra `screenshot`. An unmet wait stops replay at that step, so a mistimed step can never run blind.
- **Add screenshot steps after critical navigation.** Insert `screenshot` steps after screen transitions. These produce images in the flow result you can inspect during diagnosis.
- **Write specific executionPrerequisites.** `"App on home tab, user logged in, simulator UDID is <X>"` — not `"App running"`. Verify with `screenshot` + `describe` before acknowledging.
- **Prefer launch-app / open-url over navigation chains.** Deep links are more resilient to layout changes than tap sequences.
- **Echo accessibility labels for coordinate taps.** When recording a tap, add an echo with the target's label or testID: `"Tapping 'Submit' button (testID: submit-btn) at 0.5, 0.82"`. During repair, use `describe` to find the element by label and update coordinates. Only use `screenshot` for permission or system overlays when `describe` cannot expose the target reliably.
