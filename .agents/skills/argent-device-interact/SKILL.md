name: argent-device-interact
description: Interact with an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or Chromium (CDP) app using argent MCP tools. Use when tapping UI elements, performing gestures, scrolling/swiping, typing text, pressing hardware buttons, launching apps, opening URLs, taking screenshots, waiting for an element to appear or disappear, or checking visible app state after interactions. Not for TV targets.
---

## Unified tool surface

All interaction tools below accept a `udid` parameter and auto-dispatch iOS vs Android based on its shape (UUID → iOS simulator, `chromium-cdp-<port>` → Chromium (CDP) app, anything else → Android adb serial). You use the same tool names on every platform.

**Chromium (CDP) app** = an Electron app or a Chromium-family browser (Chrome/Brave/Edge) exposing a Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint. The same describe/tap/keyboard/screenshot surface drives it, but scrolling, tabs, cookies and storage differ — **read `references/chromium.md` before driving a `chromium` target.**

## 1. Before You Start

If you delegate simulator tasks to sub-agents, make sure they have MCP permissions.

Use `list-devices` to get a target id. Results are tagged with `platform` (`ios`, `android`, or `chromium`); booted/ready devices come first. Pick the first entry that matches the platform you need — if none are ready, call `boot-device` with `udid` (iOS), `avdName` (Android), or `electronAppPath` (boots an Electron app as a `chromium` device). A Chromium browser already running with a CDP port shows up directly — no `boot-device` needed. See `argent-ios-simulator-setup` / `argent-android-emulator-setup` for full setup flow.

**Load tool schemas before first use.** Gesture tools (`gesture-tap`, `gesture-swipe`, `gesture-pinch`, `gesture-rotate`, `gesture-custom`) may be deferred — their parameter schemas are not loaded until fetched. Always use ToolSearch to load the schemas of all gesture tools you plan to use **before** calling any of them. If you skip this step, parameters may be coerced to strings instead of numbers, causing validation errors.

## 2. Best Practices

1. **Always refer to tapping_rule** from your argent.md rule before tapping.
2. Before performing interactions, consider whether they can be **dispatched sequentially** - more on that in `run-sequence`.
3. **Use `gesture-swipe` for lists/scrolling**, not `gesture-custom`, unless you need non-linear movement. On Chromium use `gesture-scroll` instead — `gesture-swipe` is touch-only. Consider whether you need multiple swipes, if yes - use `run-sequence`. Pass `momentum: false` when the swipe should decelerate before ending for a precise movement.
4. **Tap a text field before typing**, then use `keyboard` to enter text.
5. **Coordinates are normalized** — always 0.0–1.0, not pixels.
6. **For app navigation, use the element tree returned after each action** (`--- Elements after action (describe) ---`); call `describe` only when no fresh tree is available for the current screen. It works on any screen without app restart. Do not navigate from screenshot pixels on regular in-app screens unless the tree failed to expose a reliable target. Use `native-describe-screen` only when you need app-scoped UIKit properties.

## 3. Opening Apps

**Never navigate to an app by tapping home-screen icons.** Use `launch-app` or `open-url` — they are instant and reliable.

### launch-app — by bundle ID

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "bundleId": "com.apple.MobileSMS" }
```

Common IDs: `com.apple.MobileSMS` (Messages), `com.apple.mobilesafari` (Safari), `com.apple.Preferences` (Settings), `com.apple.Maps`, `com.apple.Photos`, `com.apple.mobilemail`, `com.apple.mobilenotes`, `com.apple.MobileAddressBook` (Contacts)

### open-url — by URL scheme

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "url": "messages://" }
```

Common schemes: `messages://`, `settings://`, `maps://?q=<query>`, `tel://<number>`, `mailto:<address>`, `https://...` (Safari)

| Type text         | `keyboard`          | Every platform. Text or one named key per call, never both        |
| Paste text        | `paste`             | Only where a user would paste (OTP code, long link). Sim/emu only |
| Rotate device     | `rotate`            | Orientation changes                                               |
| Fold device       | `fold`              | Foldable iOS simulator: closed / half-open / open, or an angle    |

| Wait for UI       | `await-ui-element`  | Block until an element is visible/hidden/exists/contains text     |
| Wait for idle     | `await-screen-idle` | Block until a non-empty screen tree stops changing                |

## 5. Finding Tap Targets

IMPORTANT. When moved to a different screen after an action or do not know the coordinates of component, **always** perform proper discovery first.

| App type                          | Discovery tool            | What it returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Target app discovery              | `describe`                | Accessibility element tree for the current device screen (iOS AX-service, Android uiautomator, or Chromium DOM walker) with normalized frame coordinates. Works on any app, system dialogs, and Home screen — no app restart or `bundleId` required |
| React Native                      | `debugger-component-tree` | React component tree with names, text, testID, and (tap: x,y)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| App-scoped native                 | `native-describe-screen`  | Low-level app-scoped accessibility elements with normalized and raw coordinates; requires `bundleId`                                                                                                                                                |
| Permission / system modal overlay | `describe`                | `describe` detects system dialogs automatically and returns dialog buttons with tap coordinates. Fall back to `screenshot` only if `describe` does not expose the controls                                                                          |
| Final visual fallback             | `screenshot`              | Use only when discovery tools cannot inspect the current UI reliably. Do not derive routine in-app navigation targets from screenshots                                                                                                              |

Point follow-up native diagnostics after you already have a candidate point:

- `native-user-interactable-view-at-point`: deepest native view that would receive touch at a known raw iOS point; requires `bundleId`
- `native-view-at-point`: deepest visible native view at a known raw iOS point; requires `bundleId`

### If `describe` Tool Fails

Read the exact error and choose the action that matches it:

- Error mentions `ax-service` not available or daemon startup failure:
  the ax-service daemon could not start. Check that the simulator is booted. Use `screenshot` as a temporary fallback, or use `native-describe-screen` with an explicit `bundleId` if the app has native devtools injected.
- `describe` returns an empty element list:
  the screen may be blank, loading, or showing content without accessibility labels. Use `screenshot` to see what is visible, then retry after the content has loaded.
- `describe` succeeds but is not detailed enough for a React Native app:
  use `debugger-component-tree` next.
- You need app-scoped inspection with full UIKit properties (`accessibilityIdentifier`, `viewClassName`):
  use `native-describe-screen` with an explicit `bundleId`. This requires native devtools (dylib) injection.
- You already have a candidate point and want to confirm what would actually receive touch:
  use `native-user-interactable-view-at-point`. Use `native-view-at-point` when you want the visually deepest view instead of the hit-test target.

## 6. Tool Usage

### gesture-tap — Single tap at a point

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "x": 0.5, "y": 0.5 }
```

Coordinates: `0.0` = left/top, `1.0` = right/bottom.

Before tapping near the bottom of the screen in React Native apps, check that "Open Debugger to View Warnings" banners are not visible — tapping them breaks the debugger connection. Close them with the X icon if present.

### gesture-swipe — Straight-line gesture

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "fromX": 0.5, "fromY": 0.7, "toX": 0.5, "toY": 0.3 }
```

Swipe **up** (`fromY > toY`) = scroll content **down**. Default duration: 300ms. Optional: `"durationMs": 500` for slower swipe.

`"momentum"` defaults to `true` (a natural flinging swipe). Pass `"momentum": false` for a momentum-free swipe: the finger decelerates into the end point, resulting in little to no fling. It needs `durationMs` of at least 150 and is rejected below it.

### gesture-pinch — Two-finger pinch

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "centerX": 0.5, "centerY": 0.5, "startDistance": 0.2, "endDistance": 0.6 }
```

All values are normalized 0.0–1.0 (fractions of screen, not pixels) — same as all other gesture tools. `startDistance: 0.2` means fingers start 20% of the screen apart; `endDistance: 0.6` means they end 60% apart. `startDistance < endDistance` = pinch out (zoom in). `startDistance > endDistance` = pinch in (zoom out). Defaults: `angle: 0` (horizontal), `durationMs: 300`. Optional: `"angle": 90` for vertical axis, `"durationMs": 500` for slower pinch, `"endCenterX"`/`"endCenterY"` to let the centroid drift to a new center over the gesture (omitted = fixed center).

### gesture-rotate — Two-finger rotation

```json
{
  "udid": "<UDID>",
  "centerX": 0.5,
  "centerY": 0.5,
  "radius": 0.15,
  "startAngle": 0,
  "endAngle": 90
}
```

All positions and radii are normalized 0.0–1.0 (fractions of screen, not pixels). `radius: 0.15` means each finger is 15% of the screen away from center. `endAngle > startAngle` = clockwise. Default duration: 300ms. Optional: `"durationMs": 500` for slower rotation, and `"radiusX"`/`"radiusY"` (fractions of screen width/height; give both — they override `radius`) with `radiusX·width = radiusY·height` for a physically circular orbit — a single `radius` traces a physical ellipse on a non-square screen, coupling a slight pinch into the turn.

### gesture-custom — Custom touch sequence

For long-press, drag-and-drop, and other complex sequences, see `references/gesture-examples.md`. Set `"interpolate": 10` to auto-generate smooth intermediate Move events between keyframes.

### button — Hardware button press

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "button": "home" }
```

Values: `home`, `back`, `power`, `volumeUp`, `volumeDown`, `appSwitch`, `actionButton`

### keyboard — Type text or press special keys

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "text": "search query" }
```

One call does one action. `text` and `key` are mutually exclusive, and a call that carries both is rejected with nothing typed. To type and then submit, send two `keyboard` steps in one `run-sequence` (§ 8) — `{ "text": "search query" }`, then `{ "key": "enter" }`. Two separate calls do the same work, but cost an extra round-trip.

Special keys: `enter`, `escape`, `backspace`, `tab`, `space`, `arrow-up`, `arrow-down`, `arrow-left`, `arrow-right`, `f1`–`f12`. Optional: `"delayMs": 100` between keystrokes (default 50ms) — applies to the iOS simulator and Chromium; it is ignored on Android phones/tablets (typed via `adb input text`, no per-key cadence), on Vega, and on TV targets.

**Typing secrets.** To enter a credential without its plaintext ever entering your context, transcript, or logs, use a secret placeholder in `text` (works in `keyboard`, `paste`, `run-sequence` keyboard steps, and flow `type` steps):

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "text": "{{secret:APP_PASSWORD}}" }
```

Where the value is read from, and the rules for using a placeholder — including not screenshotting the field afterwards — are in `references/secrets.md`. Read it before typing any credential.

### paste — Paste text into the focused field

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "text": "482913" }
```

Puts `text` on the **device** clipboard (the host clipboard is untouched) and triggers the platform's paste shortcut. iOS simulator and Android emulator only; a TV target, a physical device, Chromium and Vega are rejected.

`paste` is **not** a faster `keyboard`. `keyboard` types the way a user types and stays the default for every text entry — a search query, a login, a form field. Reach for `paste` only where a real user would paste: a 2FA / OTP code copied from another app, a long link or token, or to test how the app handles pasted input. It also carries what `keyboard` can't type on a given platform (multi-line text, non-ASCII on Android), but that alone is not a reason to paste — ask whether the user would.

Tap the field first so it has focus; pasting with no focused field is a silent no-op, as with `keyboard`. `text` accepts the same `{{secret:<NAME>}}` placeholders as `keyboard`, with the same auto-screenshot skip.

### rotate — Change orientation

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "orientation": "LandscapeLeft" }
```

Values: `Portrait`, `LandscapeLeft`, `LandscapeRight`, `PortraitUpsideDown`

On an unfolded foldable simulator, the value sets the orientation of the device, not of the UI. `Portrait` gives a landscape UI. `LandscapeLeft` gives a portrait UI.

### fold — Fold or unfold a foldable simulator

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "posture": "open" }
```

Give `posture` (`closed`, `half-open` or `open`) or `angle` (0–180). Do not give both.

Use `fold` only on a foldable iOS simulator. `list-devices` marks it with `foldable: true`, for example the iPhone Duo. Other devices reject the call.

Closed, the cover panel shows the UI. Half-open and open, the inner panel shows the UI. All tools use the active panel (the panel that shows the UI), also after a fold made outside argent. `fold` returns when the device accepts input again, so the next tap lands. This is also true for the next step in `run-sequence`.

Rules:

- The coordinates change with the panel. Before you tap, read the element tree in the `fold` result, or run `describe` again. Do not use frames from before the fold.
- The screenshot size changes with the panel. Keep one screenshot-diff baseline for each posture.
- Unfolded, the UI is landscape. The screenshot shows the UI turned 90 degrees, and the `describe` frames use the same axes, as on a rotated iPhone.
- A fold between two angles that are not 0 or 180 can keep the current panel. The result names the active panel. To change panels, fold to `closed` or `open`.
- Fold between gestures, not during a gesture. A gesture stays on the panel where it started.
- If argent cannot find the active panel, it uses the cover panel. The tool result then has a `warning`, and a screenshot-diff summary has a `panel:` line. Take a screenshot to see what the device shows, then do the check that the warning gives.

### await-ui-element — Block until a UI element reaches a state

**Never poll `screenshot`/`describe` in a loop to wait for something.** Use `await-ui-element`: it blocks server-side on the same tree `describe` reads. It has no bare-timer mode by design — for a plain pause, use your own harness sleep.

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "condition": "visible", "selector": { "text": "Continue" } }
```

The tool's own description carries the conditions, selector matching, defaults and return shape. What it does not tell you:

- A `hidden` check that succeeds **immediately** may be a false pass — its `note` then says the selector never matched anything at all. Treat that as a failed check and fix the selector; do not read it as "the element went away".
- The synthetic `ROOT` container `describe` prints is never matched, so a `role` like `AXGroup`/`html` won't trivially "match the screen".
- To disambiguate a loose selector, pin the `role` to a text role like `StaticText` — that skips a same-named button.
- On a `text` timeout the `note` quotes the text of the element the check actually read, so you can see which match it landed on.

### await-screen-idle — Block until the screen stops changing

Use after launch/navigation and before a raw tap, when an early-painted element may still be moving:

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "timeoutMs": 3000, "minStableMs": 250 }
```

On local iOS, Android, and Chromium, the tool waits for a non-empty `describe` tree to stop changing. Continue only when `settled: true`. Pair it with a destination-specific `await-ui-element`; stillness does not identify a screen.

Use it only for live diagnosis. Do not record it or put it in `run-sequence`. Flows use `await: { idle: true }`, which also compares pixels. This live tool can return during a presentation-layer animation.

## 7. Screenshots

Use the explicit `screenshot` tool only when:

- You need the initial screen state before any action.
- You are about to edit visible UI and need a baseline capture before making changes.
- The auto-attached screenshot shows a transitional or loading frame.
- You require extra context.
- You want to check state after a delay (e.g. waiting for a network response).
- A permission dialog, system alert, or native modal overlay is visible and `describe` did not expose reliable targets.

When using `screenshot` for permission or native modal navigation:

- Do not switch to screenshot-driven navigation just because a modal is visible. On regular app screens and in-app modals, keep using `describe`.
- Prefer obvious, centered alert buttons such as `Allow`, `OK`, `Don't Allow`, `Not Now`, or `Continue`.
- Tap one control at a time and inspect the returned auto-screenshot before doing anything else.
- After the modal is dismissed, return to normal discovery with `describe`, `native-describe-screen`, or `debugger-component-tree`.

> **Prefer the dialog over the Settings tool.** When the app triggers its own permission prompt, answering it here is the real user path — do that. Reach for the `settings-permissions` tool only when you can't get to the change through the app: pre-authorize/deny a permission _before_ the app asks, re-enable one the user already denied (iOS won't re-prompt), or reset it so the prompt reappears. See the `argent-settings-permissions` skill.

Optional rotation parameter: `{ "udid": "<UDID>", "rotation": "LandscapeLeft" }` — rotates the capture without changing simulator orientation.

Screenshots are downscaled by default (30% of original resolution) to reduce context size. Use the normal downscaled screenshot for UI context and state checks. `scale` accepts values from 0.01 to 1.0, but do not use `scale: 1.0` as a general readability or tapping aid.

Use full-resolution screenshots only when saving baseline/current PNG files for comparison. In that case, suppress the image block so the full-size PNG is not loaded into agent context:

```json
{ "udid": "<UDID>", "scale": 1.0, "includeImageInContext": false }
```

For visual regression checks, before/after screenshot comparisons, and detailed `screenshot-diff` parameter guidance, use the `argent-screenshot-diff` skill. Keep this skill focused on device interaction mechanics and screenshot capture.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Solution                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Screenshot times out    | Restart the simulator-server via `stop-simulator-server` tool |
| No booted iOS simulator | Call `boot-device` with the iOS `udid`                        |
| No ready Android device | Call `boot-device` with `avdName`                             |

## 8. Action Sequencing with `run-sequence`

Use `run-sequence` to batch multiple interaction steps into **a single tool call**. Only one screenshot is returned — after all steps complete.

Do **not** use `run-sequence` when any step depends on observing the result of a previous step.

### Use cases

- "scroll to bottom", "scroll to top", "scroll until X" -> sequence 3-5 scrolls
- form interactions, "clear and retype field" -> triple-tap to select all, then type the new value
- "submit form" → fill all fields in sequence, tap submit
- "go back to X" → defined tap sequence for the navigation

### Allowed tools inside `run-sequence`

`gesture-tap`, `gesture-swipe`, `gesture-scroll`, `gesture-drag`, `gesture-custom`, `gesture-pinch`, `gesture-rotate`, `button`, `keyboard`, `paste`, `rotate`, `shake`, `fold`, `tv-remote`, `await-ui-element`

The `udid` is shared — do **not** include it in each step's `args`. Optional `delayMs` per step (default 100ms).

Add an `await-ui-element` step to gate a later tap on a screen transition (e.g. tap → wait for the next screen's button → tap it). If its condition is **not** met before the timeout, the sequence stops at that step and the following steps do **not** run — so a mistimed tap can't fire against a screen that never settled.

### Examples

Scroll down three times:

```json
{
  "udid": "<UDID>",
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "gesture-swipe", "args": { "fromX": 0.5, "fromY": 0.7, "toX": 0.5, "toY": 0.3 } },
    { "tool": "gesture-swipe", "args": { "fromX": 0.5, "fromY": 0.7, "toX": 0.5, "toY": 0.3 } },
    { "tool": "gesture-swipe", "args": { "fromX": 0.5, "fromY": 0.7, "toX": 0.5, "toY": 0.3 } }
  ]
}
```

Type into a focused field and submit. This is the only way to mix text and a key, because one `keyboard` call cannot carry both:

```json
{
  "udid": "<UDID>",
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "keyboard", "args": { "text": "hello world" } },
    { "tool": "keyboard", "args": { "key": "enter" } }
  ]
}
```

Tap a known button, then scroll down:

```json
{
  "udid": "<UDID>",
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "gesture-tap", "args": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0.15 } },
    {
      "tool": "gesture-swipe",
      "args": { "fromX": 0.5, "fromY": 0.7, "toX": 0.5, "toY": 0.3 },
      "delayMs": 300
    }
  ]
}
```

Tap, wait for the next screen, then act on it — the `await-ui-element` step **gates** the tap after it:

```json
{
  "udid": "<UDID>",
  "steps": [
    { "tool": "gesture-tap", "args": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0.9 } },

Prefer this over a fixed `delayMs` when a step depends on a screen transition: it adapts to real load time, and if the condition is not met before the timeout the sequence **stops there** so the next tap can't fire against a screen that never settled.

Stops on the first error (or unmet `await-ui-element` condition) and returns partial results.

## 9. Platform-specific notes

### Android

- **Metro reachability**: run `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` on the device before the RN app starts, or Metro won't be reachable from the device. See `argent-metro-debugger` for the full workflow. Re-run if the device restarts.
- **First-launch permission prompts**: `reinstall-app` on Android always installs with `-g` so runtime permissions are pre-granted on first launch — no flag to pass.
- **Locked screen / secure surfaces**: `describe` throws a clear error if it can't capture (keyguard, DRM, Play Integrity). Unlock the device or fall back to `screenshot`.
- **APK vs .app in `reinstall-app`**: pass `.apk` absolute path on Android; `.app` directory on iOS.

### Chromium
